This software is under active development and not yet ready for consumption by
end-users. If you are looking for a ROS interface to the ifm O3D303,
please consider using [o3d3xx-ros](https://github.com/lovepark/o3d3xx-ros).

Please do check back here soon as this project will support both the O3D and
the soon-to-be-released O3X. We expect to start supporting *early adopter*
users by mid-April 2017.
